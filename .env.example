# Backend Node.js/Express App - Environment Variables
# Rename this file to .env in your deployment environment and fill in actual values

# Firebase Admin SDK configuration
# Option 1: Path to your service account key JSON file
# Ensure this file is securely managed and accessible in your deployment environment
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./path/to/your/firebase-service-account-key.json

# Option 2: Base64 encoded content of your service account key JSON (if your host supports it)
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64=your_base64_encoded_service_account_key_json_content
# (You would then decode this in server.js before initializing Firebase Admin)

# If using Option 2, server.js would need modification to decode and parse this.
# For simplicity, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH is often easier if file system access is available.

# Database connection strings or other sensitive credentials
# DB_HOST=your_db_host
# DB_USER=your_db_user
# DB_PASS=your_db_password

# Any other API keys or secrets
